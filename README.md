These are two notebooks I used for a presentation on Matrix Factorisation Techniques for Recommender Systems I did for the Dublin Data Science meetup [link](https://www.meetup.com/Dublin-Data-Science/events/248157823/).

The two papers I based my talk on

1. [Collaborative Filtering for Implicit Feedback Datasets](http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/4781121/)
2. [Matrix Factorization Techniques for Recommender Systems](http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/5197422/)
